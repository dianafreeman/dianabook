##  Overview

This project has two components: 



the `client` includes a collection of components that I have started in other projects, then abandoned but saved in case I want to revisit them later. 



the `server` is the dianabook REST api. Endpoints [will] include: 

- projects/
- technologies/
- clients/
- assets/
- tags/



the `hub` is the self-service client for the `server` application
